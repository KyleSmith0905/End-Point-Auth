# Technical Assessment

## Libraries Used

#### Dependancies
- Express (A backend framework. In foresight, I should have considered using nodeJS's http library).
- Firebase Admin (The auth library. Firebase Admin has special admin functions for backends).
- Firebase (The auth library. Firebase Admin without special admin abilities).

#### Dev Dependancies
- Jest (A testing framework).
- Babel (Compiles code so it's readable by Jest).
- SuperTest (Allows Jest to test Express, though I am positive it would not be beyond reach to make tests without it).
